# Otomi: Self-hosted PaaS for Kubernetes

<img src="./otomi-console.png" alt="otomi-screenshot"/>

[Otomi](https://otomi.io/) is an open source self-hosted PaaS for Kubernetes and connects many of the technologies found in the CNCF landscape in a single installable package to provide direct value to developers.

Otomi:

- Brings a full PaaS (like Heroku) to your Kubernetes cluster. The only thing you'll need to do is to build your application image and configure Otomi to use it

- Allows you to use a PaaS on top of K8s without the constraints and abstractions of traditional PaaS offerings like OpenShift, Cloud Foundry and Heroku

- Removes the burden of building and maintaining your internal (developer) platform, lowers the burden on operations, and empowers developers to focus on application deployment and management only

## About the workshop

The workshop aims to demonstrate different use cases and features of [Otomi](https://github.com/redkubes/otomi-core) through hands-on labs.

## For who is the workshop?

- Developers
- Solutions Architects
- DevOps Engineers
- SREs
- Infrastructure & Cloud Engineers
- Product Managers

## üéä Learning objectives

The main objective is to get a good understanding/overview of Otomi and be able to identify its benefits and possible use cases for it.

## üõ† Lab prerequisites

- A K8s cluster with at least 16 vCPU and 32GiB memory
- Otomi installed
- CLI tools used in the labs
  - [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
  - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
  - Optionally: [K9s](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

## üöÄ Labs

The workshop is organized into several labs:

- Lab 1: [Creating Teams](01-create-team/README.md)
- Lab 2: [Using Knative](02-knative/README.md)
- Lab 3: [Activate apps](03-activate-apps/README.md)
- Lab 4: [Configuring network policies](04-netpols/README.md)
- Lab 5: [Using Harbor](05-harbor/README.md)
- Lab 6: [Creating a microservice architecture](06-microservice-architecture/README.md)
- Lab 7: [Working with Argo CD](07-argocd/README.md)
- Lab 8: [Create and use secrets using Hashicorp Vault](08-secrets/README.md)
- Lab 9: [Github CI + Otomi workflow](09-github-ci-workflow/README.md)

After completing the labs, you'll be able to:

- Use the Teams feature in Otomi for multi-tenancy and network isolation
- Use the Otomi web UI to expose K8s services and configure network policies between workloads
- Explain the difference between Otomi core apps and how to activate optional apps
- Create Knative workloads using the Otomi web UI
- Expose workloads in a microservice architecture, allowing multiple workloads in different team namespaces to work together
